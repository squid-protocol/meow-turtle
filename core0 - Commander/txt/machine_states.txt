# lib/machine_states.py - Standardized State Constants (v5.30)
# PURPOSE: Defines the allowable operational modes for the System and Picos.
# COMPLIANCE: Core 0 Spec Sections 7.1, 13.1, and MTIP Wire Format 4.3.8.
# ROLE: Pure definition file. No logic or imports allowed.

"""
[Spec 13.1] Ninelives Standardized Machine States.

This module serves as the central registry for all state constants used across 
the Ninelives architecture. It ensures that the Digital Twin, System Coordinator, 
and hardware fleet share a unified language for operational modes, verification, 
and safety severities.

Sections:
1. System States (Spec 13.1): High-level operational modes of the RP5 Brain.
2. Connection States (Spec 20.0): Connectivity status within the Digital Twin.
3. Pico States (Spec 13.1): Reported states from the distributed hardware nodes.
4. Verification Spectrum (Spec 3.2): Actuator confirmation badges for closed-loop logic.
5. Operational Profiles (Spec 14.0): Master keys for sorting 'Recipes'.
6. Alarm Severities (Spec 18.3): Priority levels for the system-wide safety manager.
