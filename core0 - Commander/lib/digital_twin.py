# lib/digital_twin.py - Ninelives Core 0 (v6.5.3 Passive Mirror)
# ROLE: The Passive Whiteboard. Central source of truth for reported reality.
# PURPOSE: Pure data storage. Zero logic. Zero decisions. Zero calculations.
# COMPLIANCE: Spec 3 (Structure), Spec 6 (Hierarchy), Spec 4.3.7 (Status metrics)

"""
[Spec 3.0] Ninelives Digital Twin System.

The Digital Twin serves as the single source of truth for the entire Ninelives 
architecture. It acts as a real-time, memory-resident mirror of the physical 
hardware. Per Goal 1, the UI and logic processes never query hardware directly; 
they interact exclusively with this passive model.

Architectural Roles:
1. Data Model (Spec 3.1): Hierarchical representation of Host, Limbs, and Components.
2. Verification Hub (Spec 3.2): Tracks the 'Verification Spectrum' for actuators.
3. Telemetry Sink (Spec 6.1): Ingests high-frequency sensor data from the Nervous System.
4. Health Registry (Spec 20): Holds the raw metrics used for LQI and RTT calculations.
