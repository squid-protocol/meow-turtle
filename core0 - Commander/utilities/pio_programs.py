"""
[Spec 13.0] High-Speed Tachometry & PIO Strategy.
Defines the shared PIO assembly programs for the RP2040/RP2350 platform.
Offloads high-frequency pulse counting from the Machinist CPU (Spec 11.6) to
the dedicated Programmable I/O hardware, ensuring 0% CPU overhead and
deterministic edge detection critical for "Time as Distance" synchronization.
